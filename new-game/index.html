<h2>Birdy Revenge</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Get back your eggs
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Revenge
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Keyboard UP / Down input.  Avoid all obst as they speed up.  
Dodge everything (except clouds lol).
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Challenging minigame with nice relaxing visuals and music.
Takes less than 1 minute to win the game, but it is hard!
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Use up and down keys to move.  Obstacles spawn randomly and will 
instantly kill the player.  To win you must reach the goal of 2000m.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
A helicopter like game with a twist.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Movement - super simple, but a little tricky and takes some getting used to.
Visuals - cartoon world with many sprites.
Music - homemade tune just for this game.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The dastardly crows have stolen your eggs.  Get them back!! Take your 
revenge on them and fly to the rescue.  Your babies are in danger!
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
It was a calm and beautiful morning in the nest when without warning the
crows descended and snatched all of your eggs.  They stored them in their
lair, exactly 2km away from your nest.  No time to wait!! Get your babes back!
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Fast pased game.  Challenging.  Those who like good music.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Less than 1 minute to win, but you probably won't win the first time.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Fly in the middle.  Birds spawn in the top, trees on the bottom.  So if you're
in the middle you have the most room to work with.
