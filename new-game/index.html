<h2>Birdy Revenge</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Defend Earth from Meteors!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Asteroid heading for earth
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
keyboard input, asteroids spawn randomly, action-minigame genre, fast pased
play style. bump into meteors to send them flying.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
This game has strange physics and asteroids come quickly, so as a player you 
must be fully focused and aware.  It is difficult to move the main character
so that the game has a learning curve.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player may use arrow keys to move meteor-man around.  The player floats around
and is a tad difficult to control.  The goal is to hit meteors back away from the 
planet.  If meteors collide, they disapear and your score increases.  If a meteor
hits the planet, your health goes down.  When health reaches 0, game over!

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
A simple mini game that has potential to be addictive.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Movement- is a bit difficult (on purpose). The meteors can only be removed by
bumping them into each other (NOT shooting them).
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
It all comes down to this.  The great meteor shower has come, and Meteor Man
is the last hope.  Swooping around on his rainbow could, Meteor Man is invunerable
to the asteroids.  He was born with the unique ability to bounce them off of his magical
star rainbow.  
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
Meteor man will continue to solve other mysteries around the galaxy.  His magic
star rainbow is not just immune to meteors but also nuclear bombs, tsunamis, and
lemon pie.  As he grows in strength his role expands to save the entire universe.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Players looking for a quick game.  Players looking for a challenging mini game.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Less than 3 minutes.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The more meteors removed, the better.  So hitting them into each other is a way
to manage the barage.  Learning the mechanics of how the player move will help
the player to control and maneuver more sucessfully.
